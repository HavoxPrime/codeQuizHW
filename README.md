This is a Quiz that i made based on the Portal series.
![Quiz for the Portal series](https://github.com/HavoxPrime/codeQuizHW/blob/main/assets/imgs/codeQuizHWpic.png)

- Using bootstrap for the html and basicly skiping the css was great.
- Wish i used jquery but i wasn't thinking.
- This project got kinda hary for a bit because i wrote a bunch of code that i didn't need and I didn't test frequlenty enough so i didn't have to guess what was wrong.

## Usage

Fun, I hope?
